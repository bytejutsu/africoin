    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Africoin is a revolutionary cryptocurrency designed to meet the unique needs of African communities.
        Developed from scratch as part of an academic initiative, Africoin offers a fully functional blockchain, secure
        transactions, and a user-friendly wallet. The concept was born out of the need to create a cryptocurrency that is
        easily mined and seamlessly transferred between users, tailored to the local infrastructure and real-world needs of
        the African market.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Inspired by the International University of Tunis' vision to serve the African youth, Africoin is an attempt to
        empower individuals by giving them a practical, accessible way to engage with digital currencies. This innovative
        project was developed by Dhia Eddine Nabli as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) under the ByteJutsu startup, showcasing
        the potential of blockchain in Africa.
